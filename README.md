# Genetic-Cube
A Genetic Algorithm solver for Daniel Shiffman's Rubik's cube

Uses a GA to generate a solution to a rubiks cube made by The Coding Train in CC #142, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U2gsbNe1Uo
The code for the original cube can be found here: https://github.com/CodingTrain/website/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_142_Rubiks_Cube_3/Processing/CC_142_Rubiks_Cube_3
